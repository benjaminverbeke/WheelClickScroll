# WheelClickScroll

WheelClickScroll is a macOS application that replicates the native Windows wheel mouse click feature, enabling scrolling through web pages and documents with vertical mouse movements.

## Features

- Introduces a scroll mode triggered by a middle mouse button click, enabling the page to be scrolled based on vertical mouse movements.
- Allows customization of various settings through the menulet available in the top bar.

## Prerequisites

Before using WheelClickScroll, ensure that you have met the following prerequisites:

1. Grant Accessibility permissions to WheelClickScroll.app in the "Privacy & Security" tab of the macOS System Settings. This allows the application to emulate the scroll wheel functionality.

## Installation

To install WheelClickScroll, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest release of WheelClickScroll from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/benjaminverbeke/WheelClickScroll).
2. Extract the downloaded archive to a convenient location on your macOS system (ex: the "Applications" folder)
3. Hold the Cmd key and right-click on the extracted "WheelClickScroll.app" file
4. Select "Open" from the context menu
5. Select "Open" again.

This convoluted way of opening the application is due to the application not being signed.
After the initial opening, a double-click will suffice to open the application.

## Usage

To use WheelClickScroll, follow these steps:

1. Open the WheelClickScroll application.
2. Once the application is running, you can click the middle mouse button to enter in Scroll Mode.
3. Move your mouse up and down to scroll through the current page or document.
4. To quit the Scroll Mode, click on any mouse button.

## Recommendation

Set the WheelClickScroll application to start automatically when you logs in by adding it to the "Login items" in the "General" tab of the macOS System Settings.

## Customization

WheelClickScroll provides various settings that can be customized through the menulet available in the top bar (search for the sign: â†• - double arrow up/down). You can adjust these settings according to your preferences to enhance your scrolling experience.
